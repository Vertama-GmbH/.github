# Vertama Github Development Resources ðŸ‘‹

On here you will find the Vertama Development Resources which are managed on Github. Github is neither our only, nor even our primary repository server. So do not expect to find anything of importance here. You might even see exactly nothing, as most repos are private. This might change over time, as we hope to more clearly separate product and generic code, so we might release useful stuff we build for ourselves into the public domain/open source. That would be happen on here. And maybe some developers topics blog posts, stuff related to our industry, which might be intersting for others as well. This remains to be seen, for now, it is just single lonely README ;)

have fun
